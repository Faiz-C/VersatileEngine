# VersatileEngine
The VersatileEngine, or VerseEngine for short, is my own 2D game development engine/library. I made this engine from scratch in hopes I can help other game developers to help build games. The engine is fully extensible, allowing for others to make components for it.

# Usage
Currently, the project needs to be converted to a .jar and added as an external library and the dependencies it requires need to be added as well. I recommend using Maven to use the project as all the dependencies can be grabbed from the pom.xml of the project. I know this is a unconvient way of using the library/engine, but I am working on a better way in my free time.

** THE SPRITES AND SOUND BYTE ARE NOT MINE, I BORROWED THEM FROM opengameart.org and freesound.org RESPECTIVELY **

All credit goes to the original creators and they can be found below:

The sprites used for the animation showcase come from bagzie on opengameart.org and can be found here: https://opengameart.org/content/bat-sprite
The sound byte used for the sound showcase come from yummie on freesound.org and can be found here: https://freesound.org/people/yummie/sounds/410574

# Additional Information
Nearly finished the VersatileEngine, now working easily usable with a single class instead of having to build it yourself. The engine will be updated and refined more over time as I get time to update it. For now, enjoy this library I made to help you develop games in java.

# VersatileEngine
The VersatileEngine, or VerseEngine for short, is my own 2D game development engine/library. I made this engine from scratch in hopes I can help other game developers to help build games. The engine is fully extensible, allowing for others to make components for it or even make their own engines from the framework I have made.

# Usage
Currently, the project needs to be converted to a .jar and added as an external library and the dependencies it requires need to be added as well. I recommend using Maven to use the project as all the dependencies can be grabbed from the pom.xml of the project. I know this is a unconvient way of using the library/engine, but I am working on a better way in my free time.

# Current Progress
The VersatileEngine is now completed and has been tested as well. Next task is to put it into practical use and see where it falls short and then fix its
short comings. There is now a single class which holds the VerseEngine (instead of having to put it together yourself). This will allow for those who want
to get straight to developing the game have a better time, all while allowing for those who want to explore building an engine from the framework to do so.

# To Do
-- Add more unit testing

-- Add more exception handling

-- Add way more documentation to help with usage

# Additional Information
There is a bunch of tests provided to help you understand how different components integrate with each other and how to use each pre-defined component.

# VersatileEngine
The VersatileGameEngine or VerseEngine for short is my own 2D game development engine. I made this engine from scratch in hopes I can help other
game developers to help build games. The engine is fully extensible to allow for others to make components for it and let others use those components to help them build games.

# Usage
Soon to come.

# Additional Information
Currently this is just the first release (or working version) of the VersatileEngine. The engine will be updated and refined more over time as I get time to update it. For now, enjoy this library I made to help you develop games in java. Also, as an aside, documentation will cover all parts of the engine soon.

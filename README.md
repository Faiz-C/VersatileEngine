# VerseEngine
My own 2D Game Development Engine

# Description
Soon to come.

# Usage
Soon to come.

# Additional Information
Currently this is just the first release (or working version) of the VerseEngine. The engine will be updated and refined more over time as I get time to update it. For now, enjoy this library I made to help you develop games in java. Also, as an aside, documentation will cover all parts of the engine soon.
